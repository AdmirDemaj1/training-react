# useState

- Hooks are used to make the React application behave based on event listeners. It giveslife of functionalities to our Components.

- Components wont rerender if a certain variable is gonna change. The only two cases that make a react componnet rerender are when :
1) Props change
2) State change

- We have to tell react when we want to make a component rerender.

How it works:
- useState is a `function` which is bult by react which returns a value(any type) and a function.
- we can also provide a default value for the state.
