# Paasing Children inside a component

- In ReactJS, both passing props and passing children are common techniques used to pass data or functionality from a parent component to a child component.

## Passing Children 
1) Children in React are the nested components or elements within a parent component.
2) Children are passed as nested elements between the opening and closing tags of the parent component in JSX.
For example: <ParentComponent><ChildComponent /></ParentComponent>.
3)Children are more flexible and dynamic compared to props. They allow passing complex structures,
 including other React components, JSX elements, or even strings.
4)  Children are accessed within the parent component using the special props.children property.
 This property represents the content (child elements) nested within the parent component.
5) Children allow for more dynamic composition of components and are often used for creating reusable components with varying content.

## When to use props/children?

Use Props When:

You need to pass data or callback functions from a parent component to a child component.
The data being passed is relatively static and doesn't change frequently.
You want to maintain explicitness and clarity in your component's API, as props are declared and documented in the component's propTypes or TypeScript interface.
You want to ensure immutability of the passed data, as props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.


Use Children When:

You want to compose components with varying content or structure dynamically.
The content being passed to the child component may vary or change frequently.
You need more flexibility in the structure of the child component, allowing it to render different sets of elements or components.
You want to create more reusable and flexible components that can accept different types of content.
