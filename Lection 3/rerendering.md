In ReactJS, rerendering refers to the process of updating the user interface (UI) based on changes to the component's state or props. When the state or props of a component change, React automatically triggers a rerendering process to reflect those changes in the UI.

Here's how the concept of rerendering works in ReactJS:

State and Props Changes: Rerendering typically occurs when there's a change in either the component's state or its props. State represents the internal data of the component that can change over time, while props are properties passed to a component from its parent.

React components rerender based on changes in their state or props. If you're updating a variable that is not directly tied to state or props, you need to explicitly trigger a rerender using the setState function or by passing updated props to the component.

But why??

React components rerender only based on changes in their state or props because React is designed to efficiently update the user interface (UI) in response to changes in data that affect the component's output. This approach is rooted in the concept of declarative programming, where you describe the desired UI based on the current state and props, and React takes care of updating the DOM to reflect those changes.

Some key reasons why React components rerender only based on changes in their state or props:

Efficiency: Limiting rerenders to changes in state or props helps optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary updates to the UI. React uses a virtual DOM and a process called reconciliation to determine the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM. By focusing on changes in state or props, React avoids costly and unnecessary rerenders that would occur if every variable change triggered a rerender.

Predictability: Rerendering based on changes in state or props leads to predictable behavior in React components. Developers can reason about when and why a component will rerender based on changes in its data dependencies (state and props). This predictability makes it easier to debug and maintain React applications, as developers can anticipate how changes to data will affect the UI.

Immutability and Data Flow: React encourages the use of immutable data and a unidirectional data flow, where data flows down from parent components to child components via props. By treating state and props as immutable data, React ensures that changes to these data sources are explicitly managed and tracked, making it easier to reason about component updates and preventing unexpected side effects.

Reusability: Rerendering based on changes in state or props promotes component reusability. Components can be composed and reused across different parts of an application, and their behavior can be controlled by passing different props or managing their internal state. This allows for a modular and flexible architecture where components can be easily combined to build complex UIs.
